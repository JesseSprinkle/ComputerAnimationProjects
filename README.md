# ComputerAnimationProjects
This is a compilation of projects from my computer animation course.
Implementation of all animation algorithms was written by myself.

Much of the framework was provided by Professor Sueda (full credit to him) to ease his grading, however it is understood that I could
write the framework myself if necessary.

Final project is not included because I forgot to push it to the repository before resetting my laptop (lesson learned, push as frequently as possible).
