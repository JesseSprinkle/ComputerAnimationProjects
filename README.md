# ComputerAnimationProjects
This is a compilation of projects from my computer animation course (aside from the final project, which I unfortunately forgot to push before I reset my laptop).

Implementation of all animation algorithms was written by myself.

Much of the framework was provided by Professor Sueda (full credit to him) to ease his grading, however it is understood that I could
write the framework myself if necessary.
